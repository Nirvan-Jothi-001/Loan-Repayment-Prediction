# Loan Repayment Likelihood Prediction Project

## Project Overview
Developed a predictive model in Python to assess the likelihood of loan repayment using a real-world bank dataset. 
The project involved data cleaning, including removing irrelevant columns, converting categorical variables into 
numerical formats, and performing descriptive and exploratory data analysis to better understand the dataset. 
Applied various machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression and decision trees among others, using 
scikit-learn to train models and predict loan default risk. Utilized matplotlib and seaborn libraries to 
create visualizations, providing insights into data trends and model results. The models achieved an 
81% accuracy rate in correctly predicting the likelihood of repayment, providing financial institutes with 
better data-driven decisions and avoiding potential financial risks.

## Tools and Libraries
This project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning)
- **pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Removed irrelevant columns and converted categorical variables into numerical formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the dataset to understand trends and relationships between variables.
3. **Model Training, Testing & Predicting**: Built predictive models using logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forest, categorical naive bayes & gaussian naive bayes models in 3 different test & train sets at 70% training & 30% testing, 75% training & 25% testing, and 80% training & 20% testing each.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Results
- All models in all train and test sets achieved an accuracy of around **81%** in correctly predicting the likelihood of repayment, due to the spread of data being very similar in every column.
- Therefore, the first set at 70% training & 30% testing is chosen and the decision tree model is chosen due to its pros and cons being suitable for this project dataset.
- The models can help provide financial institutes with better data-driven decisions and avoid potential financial risks.
