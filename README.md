# Loan Repayment Likelihood Prediction Project

## Project Overview
Developed a predictive model in Python to assess the likelihood of loan repayment using a real-world bank dataset. 
The project involved data cleaning, including removing irrelevant columns, converting categorical variables into 
numerical formats, and performing descriptive and exploratory data analysis to better understand the dataset. 
Applied various machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression and decision trees among others, using 
scikit-learn to train models and predict loan default risk. Utilized matplotlib and seaborn libraries to 
create visualizations, providing insights into data trends and model results. The models achieved an 
81% accuracy rate in correctly predicting the likelihood of repayment, providing financial institutes with 
better data-driven decisions and avoiding potential financial risks.

## Tools and Libraries
This project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning)
- **pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Power BI** (for additional visualizations)

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed unnecessary columns and preprocessed categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the dataset to understand trends and relationships between variables.
3. **Model Training**: Built predictive models using logistic regression and decision trees.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Results
- The models achieved an accuracy of **81%**, demonstrating their potential in predicting loan repayment likelihood.
- The models can help financial institutions make data-driven decisions to minimize financial risks.
